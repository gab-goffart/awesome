#IMPORTANT

You'll need some packages to make it look as mine. 

1. Arc-dark GTK theme
2. Hack Nerd Font
3. Rofi
4. compton


#Methods to reproduce
1. copy the contents of config into your ~/.config folder
2. copy the content of Xresources into your ~/.Xresources (rename ~/.Xresources to .Xresources.old and move this one as .Xresources)
3. <optional> the screenlayout folder is actually if you need some config for xrandr, feel free to not use it if you don't need to.

Install all of these, and you should be in for a treat
